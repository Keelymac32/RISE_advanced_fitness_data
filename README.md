# RISE Advanced Fitness Data
RISE is a iOS application that will track a user's Recovery, Intensity and Strain using Apple Watch Data. RISE is my computer science senior capstone project. 

## Abstract
Health based technology has advanced rapidly over the last decade allowing anyone who can purchase these devices the ability to track their individual fitness and health metrics. RISE pushes Apple’s health data services farther, past individual metric tracking, and into more advanced fitness analysis. While RISE is not the first application to provide this type of fitness data, it will be the first to do it free of charge or subscriptions. Fitness trackers and devices like WHOOP and Peloton are expensive with subscriptions ranging from $30 to $44 a month, not even including equipment. While these companies target those who already consider themselves athletes, RISE can be used by anyone with an Apple Watch. RISE will track a user’s daily Recovery, Workout Intensities and Strain using health data from the user’s Apple Watch, completely free of charge. Using HealthKit, Apple’s health database, RISE will retrieve a user’s daily workouts, activities, and heart rates to calculate how intense their workouts are and how much cardiovascular strain they’re putting on their bodies as well as how many hours they’re recovering at night. Each metric calculation is custom to the user and their own data, providing personalized analysis. By showing more than just individual statistics, RISE allows anyone, whether they consider themselves to be an athlete or not, to better understand their body’s needs. Users no longer must pay high prices to achieve their health and fitness goals.
